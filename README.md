ðŸ”¥ **Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm**, reshaping how we interact with AI. Yet, while Kotlin is a **beautiful, well-designed programming language**, it remains largely overlooked in the AI community.  

At Spartan, we believe it's time to change that. We've built and deployed **LLM-powered applications in production using Kotlin**, and it's proven to be both precise, fast, scalable. Now, we want to **showcase Kotlinâ€™s potential in the LLM space**.  

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve curated a collection of **innovative applications, libraries, and components**â€”all built in Kotlin for LLM use cases. Whether you're a Kotlin enthusiast or an AI engineer looking to explore new tools, this list is for you. ðŸš€  

Letâ€™s put Kotlin on the AI map! ðŸ’œðŸ¤–

## General LLM
